Coffhee is an encrypted decentralized exchange for trading encrypted, shielded, and confidential tokens. The core of this protocol are the shielded tokens and LayerZero general message passing contracts.

The token cUSD.e (Confidential USD.e) is a wrapped ERC20 version of USD.e that encrypts token balances for added privacy.

Example:

USD.e is locked inside a contract on BNB Chain (LayerZero Adapter)
The OFT Adapter then calls for the minting of the cUSD.e on Fhenix (receiving chain)
